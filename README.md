- Member 2: [NISHANA] - [EMEA arts and science College]

### Hosted Project LinK
[https://diyanajaferdiyanajafer.github.io/tink-her-hack-temp/]

### Project Description
[CampusIQ is a web application designed for college management. It enables students to submit complaints, access exam and event information, and interact with a chatbot, while admins can efficiently manage complaints, exams, and events.]


### The Problem statement
[Students and administrators face communication gaps, leading to delays in complaint handling, exam updates, and event notifications.]

### The Solution
[CampusIQ is a web-based platform that allows students to submit complaints, view exams and events, and get quick info via a chatbot, while admins can manage complaints and update schedules in real time.]



## Features

List the key features of your project:
- Feature 1: [Student and Admin login with authentication]
- Feature 2: [Complaint submission and tracking]
- Feature 3: [Dynamic display of exams and events]
- Feature 4: [Hardcoded chatbot for instant assistance]

---

## Implementation
[The CampusIQ project is implemented as a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Firebase is used for backend services, including Authentication (for student and admin login) and Firestore Database (to store complaints, exam info, and college events). The workflow includes:

User Authentication: Students and admins register/login using Firebase Authentication.

Student Dashboard: Students can submit complaints, view college events, and see the latest exam info. A simple chatbot answers predefined queries.

Admin Dashboard: Admins can view student complaints, update exam details, and add college events. All data is synced in real-time with Firebase Firestore.

Data Management: Firestore collections handle complaints, exams, and events, allowing seamless read/write operations through JavaScript modules.

This setup ensures a responsive, interactive, and real-time campus management system.]
